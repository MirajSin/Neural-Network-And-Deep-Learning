        "Decision tree classification is a mathematical process that involves measuring impurity, selecting the best features and thresholds to split the data, and building a tree structure to make predictions. The choice of features and thresholds is guided by criteria such as Gini impurity and information gain, which aim to reduce impurity and create informative splits in the data. The mathemaatical intuition behind the decision tree classification can be explained with the following concepts:\n",

        "1. Impurity Measure:\n",
        "\n",
        "At the heart of decision tree classification is the concept of impurity. Impurity is a measure of how mixed the class labels are in a subset of data. Common impurity measures include Gini impurity and entropy.\n",

This approach provides an intuitive way to understand how a decision tree algorithm works and why it makes certain predictions based on the input feature values.

If the feature values of a data point fall on one side of the hyperplane, it is assigned to one class; if on the other side, it is assigned to the other class.\n",

Some of the reasons why choosing an appropriate evaluation metric for classification problem are:\n",

        "Different classification problems have different requirements. For example, in a medical diagnosis task, we might want to minimize false negatives (missing a disease diagnosis), while in a spam email detection task, we may be more concerned about false positives (marking a legitimate email as spam). The choice of metric should align with these considerations.\n",
